# Front-End Developer Challenge
In this repo you will find a mock-up (in PNG and PSD form), an annotated version of the mock-up, and all the necessary assets (in a separate folder). The design is for a fictitious game called “TitanStar Legends,” and will not be repurposed or otherwise utilized by D&D Beyond – it is only a coding challenge.

Below are specific requirements we have which cannot be adequately expressed through the mock-up.  This is not a timed assignment, but it should probably take 4-5 hours. We ask that you have your assessment completed and returned within 7 days of receiving it. Good luck!
